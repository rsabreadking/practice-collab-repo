# 👥 Collab Practice Repo

Welcome to our Coding Friday GitHub collab test!  
This repo is just a sandbox for us to learn how to work together using Git, GitHub, branches, pull requests, and merging.

## 🗒️ What to Do

Each person:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create your own branch: `git checkout -b your-name-intro`
3. Edit the `team-intro.md` file — add your name and a fun fact about yourself
4. Commit + push your branch
5. Open a pull request to merge into `main`
6. Review each other’s PRs, approve & merge

This will simulate:
- Branching
- Working in parallel
- Creating + reviewing PRs
- Resolving conflicts (if needed)

Have fun and break things — this repo is just for learning 😄
